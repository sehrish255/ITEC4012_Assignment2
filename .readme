For this project I decided to include the home, login, navbar, product, footer, and navbar
I thought these were important to have on Amazon since the home is where the main page is,
Login is important to amazon since it's where prime members can access their profile. 
The navbar is great for navigating to different parts of the site. Footer is important
for navigating to the things unrelated to the main site and products like returns and policies, and the products
are what Amazon is famous for. I apologize that the site can't load due to errors in the code.
Initially the navbar showed up on localhost, but after that I continued to get errors and I wasn't sure
how to fix it, which made writing the code difficult since I couldn't see what I was doing after that.
The code references are from tutorials, various sites for help (like stack overflow), and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDV3Z1KCBvo.
